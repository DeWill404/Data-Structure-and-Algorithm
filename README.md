# Data Structures #
In computer science, a data structure is a data organisation, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.
#### This repository consist of different data-structures like,
*	[Stack](https://github.com/DeWill404/Data-Structure-and-Algorithm/tree/master/Data-Structure/Stack)
*	[Queue](https://github.com/DeWill404/Data-Structure-and-Algorithm/tree/master/Data-Structure/Queue)
*	[LinkedList](https://github.com/DeWill404/Data-Structure-and-Algorithm/tree/master/Data-Structure/LinkedList)


# Algorithms #
In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.
